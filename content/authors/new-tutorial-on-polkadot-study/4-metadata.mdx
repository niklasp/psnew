# Tutorial Metadata

Metadata helps structure polkadot.study. Docusaurs will create routes and pages
from information of your tutorials metadata and e.g. set page headers. That
enables users to navigate the website and also find your tutorial easier with
search engines. That is why you are encouraged to update the metadata of your
tutorial before submitting it.

## Front Matter

[Front matter in docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs/next/create-doc#doc-front-matter),
is a specially formatted text block that will resolve into specific DOM content
or other structured data accompaning your tutorial. One example of a complete
front matter for a polkadot.study tutorial is

```
---
tags:
  - contribute
  - polkadot.js
keywords: [tutorial, polkadot]
description: Learn how to write your tutorial on polkadot.study
level: intermediate
duration: 3h
---
```

Look at the explanations below to learn about all those parts, and why you
should add them.

### Tags

front matter item will list your tutorial on the

well on the front page under "Study Paths -> polkadot.js"
